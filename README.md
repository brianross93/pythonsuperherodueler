# pythonsuperherodueler

This is a python project that lets us create a team of superheros that fight each other

Run python3 arena.py in your terminal after you've downloaded the project

Then you can make a team name for both of your teams. You can then add Heros, Abilities, Armor, Weapons, and all sorts of fun stuff. 

After that, you create another team of heroes that also have weapons, ability, and armor. 

Then the heros fight, and you can get results who won at the end! 

It's very cool. Check it out!
